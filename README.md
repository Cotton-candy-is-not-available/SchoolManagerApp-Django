1) Clone this with `git clone`
2) Open a terminal in the cloned folder
3) Install dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt` (on a lab computer, you can use `C:\Users\Public\ANACONDA\python.exe -m pip install requirements.txt`)
4) Create a file called `.env` in your cloned folder with the value `SECRET_KEY=SOMEVALUE` where `SOMEVALUE` is from this website: https://djecrety.ir/
5) Run the server with `python manage.py runserver`
6) See if it works at http://localhost:8000
